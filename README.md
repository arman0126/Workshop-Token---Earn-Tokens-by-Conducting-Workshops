#Workshop Token - Earn Tokens by Conducting Workshops

## Project Description
The **Workshop Token** is a blockchain-based platform designed to reward instructors with tokens for conducting live workshops. It allows instructors to set up workshops, define their capacity, and reward themselves based on the number of participants. This decentralized approach ensures fair and transparent rewards for all parties involved, using blockchain technology to manage token distribution.

Participants can enroll in workshops and attend live sessions, providing instructors with additional engagement. In return, instructors are rewarded with **Workshop Tokens (WKT)**, an ERC-20 token.

## Project Vision
The vision of **Workshop Token** is to create a decentralized ecosystem for learning and knowledge sharing, where instructors are incentivized for their time and effort in conducting workshops. Through this platform, we aim to:
- Enable instructors to monetize their knowledge and expertise.
- Allow participants to engage with live workshops and earn rewards.
- Foster a decentralized learning environment using blockchain technology.

## Key Features
